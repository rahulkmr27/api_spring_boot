Run the application using any IDE of your choice which supports spring boot apps (ex STS, Eclipse with STS plugin ..)
Loop back to postman and try hitting the URLS for the services

Note: One thing you might need to take in consideration is when entering the longitude make sure you add '-' prior to the value.
